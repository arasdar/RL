# Continuous Control using Deep Reinforcement Learning: DDPG

## Introduction
The original repository contained a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) agent running in the Unity ML Agent Reacher(https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment. 

The original repository also contained a full report of the implementation which can be found here: (https://github.com/kinwo/deeprl-continuous-control/blob/master/Report.pdf)
